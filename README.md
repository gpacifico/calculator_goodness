### The difference between DEL, CE, and C
#### DEL for Delete:
This deletes the last index in a string. For example, if you put in 12345 and realize you don't want the 5, just hit DEL, 
and it'll take out the 5 leaving you with 1234. Don't like the 4 either? Just hit DEL again. Now you have 123.
#### CE for Clear Entry: 
This clears the most recent entry, so if you make a mistake in a long computation, you don't need to start all over again. 
If you put in 111 + 222 + 333 + 444 + 777 and realize you didn't want 777, just hit CE and it will take out the 777. 
Then put in the number you really want, like 555, and continue on with your computation.
#### C for Clear: 
This clears all input to the calculator. It erases everything leaving you with a fresh start.
